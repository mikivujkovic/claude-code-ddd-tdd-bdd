# Use-Case Contracts

Formal contracts for each capability. These define inputs, preconditions, rules (invariants), and outputs.

---

## Add Todo Item

**Capability**: Create a new todo item in the list

### Inputs
- `title`: string - The text describing what needs to be done

### Preconditions
- The Todo List exists and can accept new items

### Business Rules (Invariants)
1. **INV-ADD-1**: Title cannot be empty (no empty strings or whitespace-only)
2. **INV-ADD-2**: Cannot add duplicate items (case-insensitive title match)
3. **INV-ADD-3**: New items start with Status = Pending

### Outputs

#### Success Case
Returns a new `TodoItem` with:
- Unique identifier (generated by system)
- Title (as provided, after trimming)
- Status: Pending

#### Failure Cases
- **Empty/Blank Title**: "Title cannot be empty"
- **Duplicate Title**: "Item with this title already exists"

### Side Effects
- New TodoItem is added to the Todo List
- List size increases by 1

## Future Use Cases

Contracts for Complete, Rename, Reopen, and Delete will be added as we work on those capabilities.
