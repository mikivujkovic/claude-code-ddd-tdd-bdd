# Claude Code Training Repo: DDD → TDD → BDD (ToDo)

This repo contains the Claude Code workflow scaffold (commands, agents, hooks, skills) plus training docs.

## If you want to scaffold a Next.js app
Run this in the repo root 
- `npx create-next-app@latest .`

This scaffold intentionally does **not** include application feature code.

## Start the process
Open Claude Code in this folder, then run:
- `/phase`
- `/ddd:init`
