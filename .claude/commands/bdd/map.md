description: Map BDD scenarios to application/domain calls (avoid UI-step trap)
allowed-tools: Edit, Read
---
Update @docs/bdd/mapping.md:
- For each scenario in @docs/bdd/features/todo.feature, list:
  - “Step intent”
  - “Suggested application service call”
  - “Domain objects involved”
Goal: steps call services, not UI mechanics.
